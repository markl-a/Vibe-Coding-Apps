Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and learn how to build a modern web application.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 introduces several game-changing features:

- **Turbopack**: A new Rust-based bundler that's faster than Webpack
- **Server Actions**: Simplified server-side mutations
- **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic content
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better development experience

## Setting Up Your First Next.js 14 Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js 14 application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

During setup, you'll be asked several questions. Here are the recommended options:

- Would you like to use TypeScript? **Yes**
- Would you like to use ESLint? **Yes**
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? **Yes**
- Would you like to use `src/` directory? **No**
- Would you like to use App Router? **Yes**
- Would you like to customize the default import alias? **No**

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is a paradigm shift in how we build Next.js applications. Here's what makes it special:

### File-based Routing

Every folder in the `app` directory represents a route segment:

```
app/
├── page.tsx          # / route
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx      # /about route
└── blog/
    ├── page.tsx      # /blog route
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx  # /blog/:slug route
```

### Server Components by Default

All components in the App Router are Server Components by default:

```tsx
// This runs on the server
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `'use client'` directive:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching Patterns

Next.js 14 simplifies data fetching with native `fetch` API support:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Revalidate every hour
  });

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
  }

  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();

  return <div>{data.message}</div>;
}
```

## Metadata API

SEO is crucial, and Next.js 14 makes it easy:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Page Title',
  description: 'My page description',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Page Title',
    description: 'My page description',
    images: ['/og-image.jpg'],
  },
};
```

## Loading and Error States

Handle loading and error states elegantly:

```tsx
// loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

// error.tsx
'use client';

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error;
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices when working with Next.js 14:

1. **Use Server Components by default**: Only use Client Components when necessary
2. **Leverage caching**: Use appropriate caching strategies for your data
3. **Optimize images**: Use the `next/image` component for automatic optimization
4. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript for better developer experience
5. **Follow the composition pattern**: Break down complex components into smaller ones

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a major step forward in web development. The App Router, Server Components, and improved data fetching make it easier than ever to build performant, SEO-friendly applications.

Start experimenting with these features today, and you'll quickly see why Next.js is the go-to framework for React developers.
